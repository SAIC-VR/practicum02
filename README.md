# ATS ARTTECH 4135-001: Virtual Reality
## Practicum02 - *VR user and trigger interactions* 
## In class work

In this practicum you will start with the github classroom link, create your own assignment repository, clone it on to your computer, make modifications to the unity project, commit the changes, and push back the updated repository to github.

> The Unity project is already setup to work in VR with dpad navigation with a Vive and VR simulator. 

## Potential Resources:
> For this assginment, is higliy recommended looking into Unity's documentation for any specifi funtion you'd like to trigger. e.g. enable components, play video, etc.

You should also feel free to watch anything else you find helpful, post to slack if you find good videos/tutorials/websites.

## Learning Outcomes
- In Practium02 you will practice the ability to generate unity animations, and start actions based on triggers within your scene.

		- Triggers within user and other objects
3. Commit changes to repository
	3.1. Add useful commit messages: describe in detail
4. Push committed changes to github.


### Bonus points
* create new scripts
